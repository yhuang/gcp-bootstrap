OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers (IdP) describe an external IdP service that supports the OIDC standard, 
such as Google, Salesforce, and Terraform. You use an OIDC IdP when you want to establish trust between an 
OIDC-compatible IdP and your cloud platform account. This trust relationship enables access to cloud resources 
from the application, without requiring the creation of custom sign-in code or incurruing the management 
overhead of additional cloud platform user identities.
